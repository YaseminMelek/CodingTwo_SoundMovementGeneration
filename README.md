Description

My final project was inspired by one of the works in the Synchronicity exhibition by 180 Studios. The work was a robot-like physical installation comprised of actuators and sound. The movement and sound were random, but it seemed as if the robot had agency and purposeful movement. I am interested in the ideas of agency and emergence in technological bodies. Therefore, I decided to work with simple sound, movement and colour patterns to see whether a being could emerge. 
My work features a digital creature that wants to collect the particles within the scene. To achieve this, the player needs to guide the creature into generating the necessary actions which are moved to the area with particles, scanning to illuminate them and then collecting them. The input from the player is analysed and a pattern is generated through weighted randomness. The creature learns throughout the game and generates new patterns every time the player is allowed interaction. The game takes a long time to finish as there are many particles. However, the game is also not created to reach the finish line but rather to work towards generating meaningful action through interactivity.
The difficulty in the implementation was coding the weighted randomness and working with sound in p5.js which I had never done before. I had to coordinate the overlapping sounds and movements to achieve a smooth gameplay experience. Since I am new to generating sound, the game could be improved in that area. Furthermore, there can be improvements to the gameplay. For instance, adding obstacles and having the creature learn from its mistakes.
